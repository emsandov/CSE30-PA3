Description
-----------
	This simple program takes a hexadecimal number as a  string as input
 and extracts the parts of the single precision iee-754 floating point
 hexadecimal number.

How to compile
--------------
	To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing
the source files for PA0 (which should include the Makefile) and type 'make'.

How to run
----------
	To run the program, type './' (without quotation marks) followed by
the executable name and a space followed by an argument. For example:

	./fpdec 0x12345677

Normal Output
-------------
	Normal output is printed to stdout. An example of normal output would
be the following:

cs30s120br@pi-cluster-001:~/pa3$ ./fpdec 0xc47a0000
Sign Bit: 1
Unbiased Exponent: 9
Mantissa: fa0000

Abnormal output
---------------
	Abnormal output is printed to stderr. This can occur if there are too
many arguments passed into the program:

cs30s120br@pi-cluster-001:~/pa3$ ./fpdec 0 1
Incorrect number of arguments.

Usage ./fpdec {hexString}

This can also occur if there are too few arguments:

cs30s120br@pi-cluster-001:~/pa3$ ./fpdec
Incorrect number of arguments.

Usage ./fpdec {hexString}

Testing
-------

This program was tested using the sample pa3testfpdec executable that was
provided. Both programs were run with the same input and their outputs were 
redirected to two different files ( this program to myOut and pa3testfpdec to
refOut. These output were then compared using the command line tool 'diff'.
When there were no differences in output, it indicated that my program was
functioning properly.

In particular, these inputs were tested on the executable:
	- 0x12345677
	- 0x41260000
	- 0x40000000
	- 0xbf800000
	- 0xc47a0000
Furthermore, the parseNum() along with the extractParts() function was unit
tested to ensure that it returns the proper value. Test inputs included 
different values of hexadecimals.

Questions
---------

1) Your friend is stressed and asks you for your CSE 30 PA code. How do you
convince them to act with integrity?

I tell my friend that it is wrong to get code from others and that it is 
an academic integrity violation. I let them know that not only would they
put themselves at risk, but they would also put me at risk if I were to 
share my code with them. I would also tell them that they should attempt
the PA on their own so that they can actually learn and become better
programmers.

2) We strongly encourage everyone in the class to voice your opinion on the
class and the instruction team on CAPE, whether they are positive or negative.
